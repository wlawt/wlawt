Hi there! I am interested in crypto and improving blockchain infrastructure. 

Previously, I worked at Aptos Labs where I extended Gas functionality in the Aptos Virtual Machine. I was also at Foundry, a Digital Currency Group company where I built institutional staking infrastructure. 

During the day, I'm a third-year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science.
