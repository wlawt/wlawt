Hi there! I am interested in crypto and improving blockchain infrastructure. 

I currently work at Aptos Labs, on the Move Platform team. Previously, I was at Foundry, a Digital Currency Group company where I built institutional staking infrastructure. 

I'm also a third year student at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science.
